                Marie Curie was a Polish-born physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She discovered two new elements, polonium and radium, which led to groundbreaking work in nuclear physics and cancer treatment.
                Curie's remarkable achievements earned her two Nobel Prizes, making her the only person to win in two scientific fields.
